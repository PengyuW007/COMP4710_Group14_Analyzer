###    Purpose
We are going to use our algorithm and findings in our paper to contribute to the public and make the data to be visualisation to people.

Contributions: 
1. To make the public to know the situation and how's everything of covid going by government, such as the tested cases, positive cases and so on). 
2. To show the tendency of covid , how it will go in the future. Distribution of people like ages groups, human race groups.

As the two bullet points of contributions I mentioned above,  if we build a map of the number of positive cases by data visualisation, for public it is good for people to know which districts of Winnipeg are easily to be affected, or which human race(nation of people) are easier to be affected, and government can announce these group of people are better to stay at home or reduce the likelihood or frequency to go to these areas.
